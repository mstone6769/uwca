(formerly The Birmingham Community Chest) was organized in 1923 with 31 agencies and a goal of $450,000. Even in 1929, the year of the stock market crash, the goal was met as more than half a million dollars was raised-a remarkable amount, considering the economic conditions.<br>
              In 1943, during World War II, the Birmingham Community Chest campaign raised more than $1 million for the first time. In 1956, it changed its name to the United Appeal. Two years later, the $2 million milestone was passed.</p>

              <p>Today, United Way’s impact has grown to over 80 programs and initiatives and a fundraising impact of over $37 million. Throughout its history, the United Way has not changed its basic purpose-to increase the organized capacity of people to care for one another and to improve their communities.</p>
